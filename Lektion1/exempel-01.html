        <p>Tis two score years since Carroll's art,<br />
            With topsy-turvy magic,<br />
            Sent Alice wondering through a part<br />
            Half-comic and half-tragic.</p>

        <p>Enchanting Alice! Black-and-white<br />
            Has made your deeds perennial;<br />
            And naught save "Chaos and old Night"<br />
            Can part you now from Tenniel;</p>

        <p>But still you are a Type, and based<br />
            In Truth, like Lear and Hamlet;<br />
            And Types may be re-draped to taste<br />
            In cloth-of-gold or camlet.</p>

        <p>Here comes afresh Costumier, then;<br />
            That Taste may gain a wrinkle<br />
            From him who drew with such deft pen<br />
            The rags of Rip Van Winkle!</p>
